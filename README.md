# U.S. Economic Policy and Consumer Sentiment

Rodrigo Caputo --- Raymond M. Duch

There are three distinct data modules that make up this dataset.  Data module 1 consists of the principal dependent variable in Caputo and Duch, 2019, U.S. Economic Policy and Consumer Sentiment: the President’s Handling of the Economy – the index constructed is based on 895 surveys conducted over the period 1981.04 to 2018.06.  The variable is unique because the authors create a single index (based on Stimson 1999) using similarly worded survey items from different studies over time. It will be of interest for the research of economists and public opinion scholars.  A second module consists of four different extensive time series measure of consumer sentiment from University of Michigan, the Conference Board, and the OECD.  A third module consists of secondary data that are control variables in the Caputo and Duch (2019) analyses: time series of macro-economic variables, the Economic Policy Uncertainty measure from Baker et al (2016), an alternative measure of macro-economic policy management from the University of Michigan, and a time series of U.S. Presidential Approval.
