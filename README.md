# US-Economic-Policy-Uncertainty-is-Presidential

Rodrigo Caputo --- Raymond M. Duch

In this paper we investigate the extent to which policy uncertainty affects USA consumer confidence from 1985 to 2018. In doing so, we estimate the impact of an empirical measure of policy uncertainty on consumer confidence after controlling for several observable macroeconomic and political variables. We conclude that uncertainty has a negative impact on consumer confidence, after controlling for inflation, output, unemployment, real wages and stock market prices. This result is robust to the inclusion of political variables, such as the approval rate of the president. We conclude that a given shock to economic policy uncetainty has smaller effect under Trump administration. In the case of the other administrations, this shock is transmitted in a similar fashion.
